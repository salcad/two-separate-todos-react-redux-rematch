## How to make 2 identical components with each having different separate reducer using rematch, No more action types, action creators, switch statements or thunks. 

## Quick start

1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/salcad/two-separate-todos-react-redux-rematch.git`
2. Move to the appropriate directory: `cd two-separate-todos-react-redux-rematch`.<br />
3. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies.<br />
4. Run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.

Now you're ready build your beautiful React Application!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Create React App is divided into two packages:

* `create-react-app` is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects.
* `react-scripts` is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).

You almost never need to update `create-react-app` itself: it delegates all the setup to `react-scripts`.

When you run `create-react-app`, it always creates the project with the latest version of `react-scripts` so youâ€™ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
